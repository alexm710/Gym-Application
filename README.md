# Gym Application

## Project Overview 
This application will develop a weekly gym plan and fitness routine for a user depending on certain factors. For example their weight, height, ability and fitness level will affect how difficult the training program is. Furthermore, if a user completes multiple weeks in succession, the training will incrementally get hard

## Sprint 1 Review 

#### What went well
- Created an MVC which is connected to each layer (Model, View, Controller)
- Designed a WPF with a clear and illustrated layout.
- Created a databse using entity Framework using a migration.
After my inital sprint review with Astha, we have established certain aspects that could have been improved within the first Sprint.
- User stories should be written at a user level, break down the user stories.
- MVC should have a clearer design.
- ERD needs a junction table.

## Sprint 1 Retrospective 

- Since reviewing my inital sprint. I now have a clearer idea on how to develop the project. Breaking down the user stories has helped me have a clear idea and understanding of what the user requires for the project. For example, I initally had 3 user stories in a single card, however, I was able to break down the user stories as so: A user must be able to log-in with ease in order to use the application, etc. The functionality must be simplistic and easy to follow. 

- Seperating these user stories has helped me break down each task seperately and I am now able to focus on each task one by one instead of trying to partially complete everything as a whhole, which in turn, was becoming overwhlelming. Thanks to this review, I will now focus on seperating user stories for the rest of the sprints to help increase efficiency and quality.

- Cleaning up the design of my MVC has also made it much easier to manage my files and locate specific components easier. This Sprint Review will help me with my file managemeent and class management in the future.

- Finally, I have added a junction table to my ERD diagram in order to represent a many-to-many relationship between my Users and Training Program class.
