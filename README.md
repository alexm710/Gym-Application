# Gym Application

## Project Overview 
This application will develop a weekly gym plan and fitness routine for a user depending on certain factors. For example their weight, height, ability and fitness level will affect how difficult the training program is. Furthermore, if a user completes multiple weeks in succession, the training will incrementally get more difficult.

## Sprint 1 Overview  

### What went well
- Created an MVC which is connected to each layer (Model, View, Controller)
- Designed a WPF register page with a clear and illustrated layout.
- Created a databse using entity Framework using a migration.

### Sprint Review
After my inital sprint review with Astha, we have established certain aspects that could have been improved within the first Sprint.
- User stories should be written at a user level, break down the user stories.
- MVC should have a clearer design.
- ERD needs a junction table.

## Sprint 1 Retrospective 

- Since reviewing my inital sprint. I now have a clearer idea on how to develop the project. Breaking down the user stories has helped me have a clear idea and understanding of what the user requires for the project. For example, I initally had 3 user stories in a single card, however, I was able to break down the user stories as so: A user must be able to log-in with ease in order to use the application, etc. The functionality must be simplistic and easy to follow. 

- Seperating these user stories has helped me break down each task seperately and I am now able to focus on each task one by one instead of trying to partially complete everything as a whhole, which in turn, was becoming overwhlelming. Thanks to this review, I will now focus on seperating user stories for the rest of the sprints to help increase efficiency and quality.

- Cleaning up the design of my MVC has also made it much easier to manage my files and locate specific components easier. This Sprint Review will help me with my file managemeent and class management in the future.

- Finally, I have added a junction table to my ERD diagram in order to represent a many-to-many relationship between my Users and Training Program class.

## Sprint 2 Overview  

### What went well
- Completed a WPF log-in page with a clear and illustrated layout 
- Completed encryption functionality for the user's password when they log-in
- Halfway through designing the main home-page for the application.

### Sprint Review
After my inital sprint review with Astha, we have established certain aspects that could have been improved within the first Sprint.
- Encrypting and decrypting the user's password should be considered bonus functionality and is taking up too much time.
- Commit more to Github.

## Sprint 2 Retrospective

- Upon reviewing my second sprint I have realised I must time-box more, as focusing on non-essential aspects of the application is taking up too much time and I must focus on developing an MVP due to the short time-span of the project.

### What went well
- Completed a WPF log-in page with a clear and illustrated layout 
- Completed encryption functionality for the user's password when they log-in
- Halfway through designing the main home-page for the application.


## Sprint 3 Overview

### What went well
- Completed functionality and WPF design for a user to register an account.
- Majority of the main home-page design has been completed. 
- 3/4 CRUD operations working.

### Sprint Review 
Following the completion of my third sprint review, certain aspects were discussed with Astha which will be addressed below.
- I have decided to postpone the completion of decrypting a users password in order to speed up the process of developing an MVP, which me and Astha both believed was the correct decision. Therefore, the decryption user story has been added to a 'wish list' column in my project board, due too the fact completing the decryption will be bonus functionality
- Astha and I were happy with the quick progress that has been made this sprint, however we agreed for the next sprint, the remaining CRUD operation needed to be completed as soon as possible in order to have an MVP ready.

## Sprint 3 Retrospective
- Upon reflecting on the third sprint review, I believe I am on the right track after focusing on completing tasks with the highest priority instead. However, it is imperative I work efficently tomorrow in order to complete my project in such a short sprint.

## Sprint 4 Overview 

### What went well
- A mininum viable product has been achieved. All CRUD operations have been successfully implemented into the view (WPF).
- WPF front-end design has been polished with extra images and styling has been added in order to have an enticing front which would look inviting and appealing to users.
- Two more windows created in my WPF which a user can add or update exercises to their tailored weekly fitness/gym routine.
- Extra achievments partially added when a user completes a certain amount of fitnesss.

## Sprint 4 Retrospective
After completing the final sprint review, the project as a whole was reviewd with Astha which will be addressed below.
- Astha and I were happy with the work completed within this sprint. An MVP has been delivered and now I can focus on extra functionality.
- Preparation discussed about how to demonstrate the project in tomorrow's presentation.

## Sprint 5 Sprint Overview

### What went well
- Finished final touches on completing the achievments a user can recieve when completing exercises within a week.
- Completed presentation for the demonstration.

## Sprint 5 Retrospective
This small sprint wasn't essential to include, however, documenting the whole process of completing the project seemed fitting.

- Unfortunately I got food poisoning the day of the presentation. Therefore I was not able to have a sprnt review with Astha or prepare as much as I would have desired for the demonstration. However, I was able to complete a PowerPoint presentation and demonstration preparation in a short space of time.

Even after un-forseen circumstances of feeling very sickly, the presentation managed to be a success. After reviewing the project as a whole, I have gained a wealth of knowledge, especially on time-boxing important deliverables first before bonus functionality, and creating clear user stories in order to have a clear understanding of how to achieve the project goals. I will use the knowledge ascertained in this project for future experiences and projects.
